# 🦾 Iron Man Suit Simulation

A modular, multi-agent simulation system for testing Iron Man suit behavior in realistic scenarios (e.g., combat, rescue, stealth). Built using the [`crewAI`](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) framework, it uses autonomous agents to mimic subsystems of the suit such as diagnostics, shielding, biometrics, tactical decision-making, and more.
